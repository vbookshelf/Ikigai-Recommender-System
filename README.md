## Ikigai Recommender System
A simple system to match career and life skills questions to people who are able to answer them.

This was my entry in the Kaggle CareerVillage competition. The objective was to develop a method to recommend student questions to professionals who are most likely to answer them.

The data and published notebooks are available on Kaggle:

#### Some features of this prototype recommender system:

1. Simple and easy to understand.
  
2. Transparent performance.<br>
The notebook is interactive. Simply enter a question, run the notebook and immediately see if the results make sense.

3. Tailored to handle both career questions and life questions.



Ikigai is a formula for happiness and fulfillment. It's a Japanese word that roughly means "a reason for being" or "the reason you wake up in the morning". It's the area of intersection of four overlapping circles: what you love to do, what you're good at, what you get paid to do and what the world needs.

Even though this system didn't win any prizes I'm quite pleased with how it turned out.
