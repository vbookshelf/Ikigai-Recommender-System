## Ikigai Recommender System

This was my entry in the Kaggle CareerVillage competition. The objective was to develop a method to recommend student questions to professionals who are most likely to answer them.

The data and published notebooks are available on Kaggle:

Ikigai is a formula for happiness and fulfillment. It's a Japanese word that roughly means "a reason for being" or "the reason you wake up in the morning". It's the area of intersection of four overlapping circles: what you love to do, what you're good at, what you get paid to do and what the world needs.
