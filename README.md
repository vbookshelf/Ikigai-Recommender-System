<i>CareerVillage.org is a nonprofit that crowdsources career advice for underserved youth. Founded in 2011 in four classrooms in New York City, the platform has now served career advice from 25,000 volunteer professionals to over 3.5M online learners. The platform uses a Q&A style similar to StackOverflow or Quora to provide students with answers to any question about any career.

This was my entry in the Kaggle CareerVillage competition. The objective was to develop an automated recommender system to match student questions to people who can answer them.

The data and published notebooks are available on Kaggle:

Ikigai is a formula for happiness and fulfillment. It's a Japanese word that roughly means "a reason for being" or "the reason you wake up in the morning". It's the area of intersection of four overlapping circles: what you love to do, what you're good at, what you get paid to do and what the world needs.
