    "If you're like me then alot of your emails are unopened. It's because you know from reading the title or just from the sender's name that you've got no interest in the content. Who cares if a city that you visited 6 months ago now has \"some great deals on hotel rooms\". Our brains are becoming efficient content filters. Anything that's not relevant will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why it's important for CareerVillage to have a good recommender system (RecSys). Professionals need to feel that the questions sent to them are relevant. Creating a personalized experience will make them feel valued. This will lead to more questions being answered and faster answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this competition is to develop a method to recommend relevant questions to the professionals who are most likely to answer them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution follows two steps:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Step 1*: Develop a method to recommend relevant questions to professionals.<br>\n",
    "*Step 2*: Identify those professionals who are most likely to answer a relevant question.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not practical to measure the quality of this solution using an evaluation metric. To overcome this we will assess the results qualitatively using a simple run and read approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "In step 1 you'll ask a question. Then you'll look at the professionals that each model recommendeds and ask: \"Based on this person's  profile or past answer, will this recommended professional be **capable** of answering this question?\"<br>\n",
    "This is an intuitive way of assessing the relevance of your question to a particular professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "In step two, to assess whether or not a professional will respond to a relevant question, this system will look at four indicators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is this professional a new member?\n",
    "2. Has this professional answered a past question from this student?\n",
    "3. Did this professional answer a question recently?\n",
    "4. Did this professional make a comment recently?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this filter, this system will generate a final list of professionals that are likely to respond to your question.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central feature of this system is that it compares your question to each professional's background info or to all answers in the dataset. If the question is similar to a particular professional's background or to a past answer that he or she gave - then it's likely that that professional is able to answer your question. In other words, your question is relevant to that professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**RecSys Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "This recommender system is made up of the four models and a filter:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "( A professional's profile is made up of the industry they work in and their title. )\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model 1 uses tags followed, professional profiles and tfidf (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency)\n",
    "- Model 2 uses professional profiles, past answers and tfidf\n",
    "- Model 3 uses professional profiles, past answers, tfidf and Truncated SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)\n",
    "- Model 4 uses professional profiles, past answers and GloVe pre-trained word embeddings  (Global Vectors for Word Representation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need four models? It's because not all models perform equally well on all questions. This is a small dataset and different careers are not equally represented. For example theres a lot of professionals with a computer science background but few firefighters. Professions are well represented. Trades are not. Also, not all questions are about specific careers, some are about life. Therefore, having a diversity of models that tackle the problem in different ways is the most prudent approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactive Notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is set up in such a way that you'll be able to select a question from the dataset, run the entire notebook and then see a printout of results for each model, and for the filter. There's also an option to type in your own question as you would on the CareerVillage website.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing and Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this recommender system work? Yes it does. \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this fact I've tested it on nine questions that are representative of the data. The number of recommendations produced and the number of false positives in those recommendations is tabulated in section 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal here is to build a working prototype. Let's start by preparing the data."

      "It appears to me that you are interested in becoming an officer in the U.S. Army.  I retired from the U.S. Army as a Lieutenant Colonel after 30 years of service.   There are at least two ways for you to become an Army officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "After you finish high school,  you should attend a university in the U.S. that has an Army R.O.T.C. (Reserve Officers Training Corps) program.  In this way, you work towards your degree and meeting your Army Officer training simultaneously.  You'll then be commissioned at the same time you receive your Bachelors Degree.  There are ROTC scholarships for which you can apply too.  Start the application process in your (High School) Junior year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another route is to enlist in the U.S. Army and apply for and attend Officer Candidate School (OCS).  The \"catch\" here is you ultimately must have a Bachelors Degree.   I recommend getting your degree first before going the OCS route.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the route you choose, ultimately you will need to be academically strong in the following disciplines:  ENGLISH communication skills; both written and verbal.  MATH - calculus would be very beneficial in your preparation.  Be well-rounded in SCIENCES, especially \"hard sciences\" i.e. physics.  HISTORY is very important too.  Both U.S. History and World History with an emphasis on Military History.    Additionally,  we (U.S. Army) will look at your LEADERSHIP experience while in \"high school\".  For example:  President of the Chess or Robotics club, or Captain of the football or soccer team.   Being a member of a sports team or teams is something else that we look at.  We want you to be a \"TEAM PLAYER\"  and a leader.  Soccer or football or basketball or baseball will rate higher than swimming or track for example.  PHYSICAL FITNESS is vitally important.  You should be \"height / weight proportionate\".   \n",
      "\n",
      "Your background is very important too.   Membership in questionable or subversive or even anti-American organizations will be a \"war-stopper\" for you.  Your application to become an officer will be denied for these activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mean time, research the various \"branches\" within the Army.  for example:  Aviation, Field Artillery, Military Intelligence, Transportation, Cyber, Engineers, Judge Advocate, Infantry, Signal, etc..  Begin to determine what you do not want to do, then narrow it down to what you do want to do.   Math is extremely important in Artillery and Aviation.   Physical fitness as well as being academically \"well rounded\" is important in Infantry and Special Operations.   Language skills are especially important in Special Operations.\n",

This is if you choose to go active duty army. Once you have been selected to branch aviation, you will go to flight school. At flight school, based on your competiveness, you will go through another order of merit list, to choose which aircraft to fly, UH60s, CH47s, etc. Once you complete flight school your will be a pilot in the army. The key during this route is to become competitive. There are a few areas that determine competiveness, academics (GPA), leadership, and&nbsp;army physical fitness tests APFT. There may be more, but those are the biggest areas.

      " <p>Hey Clarise, it's always awesome to hear when people are interesting in the nursing field and in the Army as well. I'm currently a registered nurse in a civilian facility and also for the Maryland National Guard. I did Army ROTC during my time in college/nursing school, so that's how I ended up where I am today. But there are two ways to do nursing in the Army:</p><p><br></p><p>1) If you choose to go for your nursing degree (BSN, 4 years), you can also do Army ROTC during your time in college which basically trains you to become an officer. you can received a scholarship that can help pay for school, but you are required to serve in the Army for a certain amount of years after you graduate.  You can either join Active Duty (working full time in the Army) or the Reserves/National Guard (part time for Army).</p><p><br></p><p>2) you can join the Army after getting your degree through something called \"direct commissioning\". Once you get you degree and license, you can apply to join the Army as a nurse. Big difference between 1 &amp; 2 though is time and money: option 1 you can get all/a lot of your school paid for, but you also give a lot of time for ROTC. for 2, you can focus on school during your college years but wont have any scholarships, though the Army does provide some financial resources for paying back school loans and things like that.</p><p><br></p><p>I know this is a lot of information and I'm not sure if I explained it clearly (also tried to be relatively short &amp; concise, but there's a lot to the process haha), but if you have more questions feel free to ask! </p>\n",

      " <p>Dear Priyanka,</p><p>Greetings! I have answered this question to Eshwari few days ago. I am going to reproduce that answer with bit of modifications as required for better clarity. </p><p><br></p><p>From your background, I could make out that you are from Bangalore and a student of 10th standard but your location is Rhode Island, USA. So I am not very clear as to which Army you wish to join ? Is it the US Army or the Indian Army? It is important to know that very few foreign nationals can join Indian Army (like Nepali citizens etc.). So you have to ascertain for yourself as to which citizenship you hold and accordingly you can join armed forces of the respective countries. Both are highly professional armies and respected a lot. I shall answer the modalities about the Indian Army, assuming that is the natural choice.</p><p><br></p><p>So, to answer your query, there are following options for you to become army officer:</p><ol><li> Do your B.Sc  and that will be good as you have wider choices including flying branches in air force and executive branches in Navy. Similarly BA/B.Com if you are not looking for flying or executive branches. </li><li>  Should you wish to be doctor in Army then you can appear for entrance Test for AFMC, Pune or Army Dental College after class 12th with PCMB. However, you can do the same by attending Medical colleges from civil institutes in India/abroad.  </li><li> You can also join Military Nursing Services after B.Sc or Diploma in Nursing but majority of them are trained within army organisations (after 12th only  with PCMB). </li><li> You can join after doing your graduation in Engineering (Civil, Mech, Electrical, Electronics or Computer Sciences) or Masters in Physics with Electronics or Computers for engineering branches.</li><li>You can also join in Education Corps by doing M.Sc/MA/M.Com with or without B.Ed or in Legal services by doing your Law Degree. </li></ol><p><br></p><p>After your basic education, application and selection test processes, one has to clear SSB (Services Selection Board) which is a very stringent 5 days test (compulsory for all including Women officers except medical professionals). It is one of the best methods of test I know to assess the suitability for military services (as officers), a proven method of testing of one's psyche, leadership qualities which takes  all the aspects of your personality into account and decide.  Although, success rate is pretty low but don't get disheartened and demotivated. Key to success in SSB is a sound mind with sound body, positive attitude and basic IQ.  If I could do with an average IQ and humble  educational backgrounds, why not you?  There were many friends (within my batch) of whom we thought that they will never make it to the SSB but they did qualify and now serving as  Major General. </p><p>Please refer the links given below and you can find scores of material to read about SSB on the net or through books.</p><p>All the Very Best!

      "<p>This is a challenging but interesting question and it's great that you are considering it at this point in your life.  To be honest, I'm not sure that there is only one career path as the Army is a very large and diverse organization.  There are however a few important decisions that an individual needs to make.</p>\n",
      "<p>First, is the Army (or military) right for me?  To answer this question you should talk with your family and friends and try to find someone in the military to talk to.  The military presents you with many job, educational and travel opportunities but it is demanding work that often requires separation from your family and occasionally dangerous work. You should be sure that you want to serve in the military before joining.</p>\n",
      "<p>Second, what type of work do I want to do (Intelligence Analysis, Mechanic, Infantry, Pilot, etc...)? To help answer this question, there is a great deal of information on Army jobs (called Military Occupation Specialties) on the Army website; there are a variety of message boards accessible on the internet discussing different jobs and their associated training and assignments; and military recruiters can advise individuals on the available jobs and the requirements for each of them. Different jobs may require mechanical orientations or mathematical skills.  High school and your work experience may prepare you for your service.</p>\n",
      "<p>Third, do I want to serve as an enlisted soldier or an officer? Servicemembers of different ranks have different jobs and different responsibilities, with enlisted soldiers generally acquiring more technical skills and officers acquiring more leadership and managerial skils.  If you want to enlist then you need to have at least a high school diploma.  If you desire to serve as an officer you will need to obtain a college degree.  Accordingly, you should spend your time in high school preparing yourself for college and for completion of your pre-commissioning requirements (through Reverve Officers Training Corps or the United States Military Academy at West Point). Both of these options can assist you in paying for college but they require qualification and service in the Army after your college graduation and commissioning.  Again, the Army website is a great resource for learning about the options available to you.  Both ROTC and USMA provide great opportunities to learn about the Army and to develop yourself academically, physically and militarily while in college.  Whether you want to enlist or become an officer, you need to develop your physical fitness, maintain a good work history, and avoid any criminal behavior.</p>\n",
      "<p>Once you have joined the military the key to a successful career is hard work and teamwork.  The jobs are demanding and require you to operate in a fast-paced environment with flexibility and self-motivation. Promotions require successful service in each job and at each level of authority.  Nonetheless, you will not be alone.  In the service you will develop tremendous friendships and accomplish many goals as a unit.  Your leaders, peers and subordinates will all be important parts of your daily life and your career progression.  As you advance in rank you will have additional opportunities to pursue more military and civilian schooling, different jobs, and service in different locations in the U.S. and abroad.  The career path in the Army is no doubt unique- it will require you and your family to make many sacrifices but it also will reward you with self-development, travel and job opportunities, friendships and service.</p>\n",

      "==Answer given to similar question:\n",
      " <p>The number of military pilots transitioning into civilian flying careers has been largely dependent on the job market.  In my 19 years in the Army the industry went from like warm (when I was going through civilian aviation training in college), to cold, to blazing hot in the last couple of years.  It's an industry about timing and the military is by far the best option to maintain currency and time your entry into the civilian market.  To fly in the military you need to get a degree and commission as an officer (unless you're a warrant officer in the Army which is primarily helicopters and a degree is needed more and more to be competitive).  I would recommend joining the reserve or national guard and use the education benefits to help pay for your flight training at a civilian school (preferably part 141 to maximize your VA benefit).  While in school, you can commission through ROTC and only do two years if you're prior enlisted.  In your junior to senior you will start the as sessions process and compete for a flight slot at which point you could go active duty or attempt to get a guaranteed reserve forces duty contract (for the Army National Guard anyway, not sure about other services).  Eventually you would have the time to apply for an entry level airline job and start working your way to a major airline.</p>\n",
      "<p>You could also bypass the military all together.  There are new programs available with Jet Blue where they will pay for your training and eventually hire you once you have acquired the neccesary time.  I am uncertain how the selection process for this goes or what their terms are, but it's worth checking into.</p>\n",
      "<p>At the end of the day, it's a career path that requires passion and patience.  If you have those two things, it's the best career you could ever pursue.  If you're impatient and just \"kinda like to fly\", it will be a long and painful road!  Best of luck, and be safe!</p>\n",

      " <p>Darshan,  On the surface these two options may seem distinct and unrelated.  However; there are many areas of the armed services for engineers.  You may be able to be both an engineer and an army officer.  As stated above, there are potential benefits and drawbacks to to each path, but combining them may give you the best of both worlds.  As an example D.A.R.P.A. (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) works with, and employs, some of the best and brightest in the world and is only one small area of the military where engineering is central to the mission.</p><p><br></p><p>Hope that helps</p>\n",

      " <p>Hi, Deshawn,</p><p><br></p><p>I am a former Army Infantry Officer and  agree with a lot of the points made in your previous answers. I strongly echo the sentiment that it is very unrealistic to expect not to deploy, regardless of what branch you join. Honestly, if you don't want to deploy, I'd recommend choosing a different path than the military. Whether you are in the Army, Air Force, or Navy, deployments are at the core of what you do. If you aren't prepared to go overseas then I don't think the military is the right place for you. There are plenty of places to get experience in the two areas you mentioned and, if you want to serve, you might want to investigate the Coast Guard. I linked their careers page below.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope this helps - good luck in whatever path you ultimately choose to pursue. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have more questions about this topic.</p>\n",

Take several classes that will help you get more options like Algebra, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Geometry and never let your grade go below a C or 75.  These will open many options in the military.  You can join the Army Reserves as soon as you turn in 17th and you are in 11th grade.  Good luck.</p><p>www.goarmy.com</p>\n",

I joined the Army, and the Army introduced me to communications troubleshooting and problem solving, I was a Signal Corps officer. The Army opened up my desire to learn and helped me find my direction.</p>\n",
      "<p>By all means, if you know right now you want to be an electrical engineer, go for that degree, it will be a great investment. But I think the most valuable asset for an engineer is the wonder of life and technology. When you see a piece of technology, you think how does that work? What do I need to learn to understanding something new? </p>\n",
      "<p>My personal experience is that wonder and willingness to discover something new and create adaptive solutions are probably the best skills you can foster where you are in life. If you have a class where you can learn microprocessors/drawing circuits or even programming, take it. Both of those kinds of courses open doors to different kinds of thinking. Best of luck!</p>\n"

      " Becoming an Army officer has a couple paths you can choose. It depends if you want to go active, or guard/reserves. Either one requires a bachelors degree. You can always look into the different military academies such as West Point. They are very competative, but are the best route, with huge reward from graduating from them. Once you have a degree you can go to a recrutier about going into the Officer Corps. I would suggest speaking with a recruiter ASAP to get all of the intricate details. You may find that you want to enlist first in the reserve/guard, go to school, and then upon graduation go through OCS, or an officer program, and get your commission.

      " <p>Dominick, it is great that you are considering serving your nation at such an early age.  Now the next steps to help you prepare for the military after H.S.  If your H.S. has a JROTC program, I would recommend participating.  There is also the Marine Corps League in some areas.  If there are not MCL or JROTC programs in your area, consider playing sports that will keep you in shape for the physical rigorous life in the military, depending on your military specialty.  Running, cross training, weight lifting will get you to that level of success.  You will also need to decide in the next few years of becoming an Officer or joining the ranks of the Enlisted.  I have served for 27 years in the Army Reserves and am currently a Civil Affairs Sergeant Major.  I entered the military in 1991 with a BS degree and stayed Enlisted.    In addition to deciding Officer  or Enlisted, you will need to decide on your military career or specialty.  If you have family members in the military or have served, consider obtaining their advice.  The military has been a sacrifice for me personally and professionally, the deployments (5 and counting) away from family and my civilian career is tough.  For me I would do it already again in a heart beat - the people I have met, especially those during a deployment to Bosnia, Iraq and Kuwait have been a wonderful experience.  When you make your decision in your Junior year of H.S. you can decide on split option, or go ROTC in college.  The is also the decision to go Active Duty or Reserve/National Guard.  There is also the option of the various military academies.  There are many options for you and you have a few years to work it out for your benefit.  Remember to involve your parents, family - they will be your best supporters and cheerleaders in this endeavor.</p><p><br></p><p>Final question / consideration:  Why do you want to join the military?

      " <p>You can go into the service after going to college. Once you have a degree you would go in as an officer. Most people who go into the military after college have done ROTC in college. I believe being Rotc makes your college much cheaper, but you have to do training in the summers. (I was not Rotc so I am not sure about the specifics). Alternatively, you could go to a service academy (us. Military academy, us naval academy, us air force academy, us merchant marine academy) for free in exchange for a direct commission and requirement to serve so many years on active duty. It was 5 active and 3 reserves when I went, not sure what it is now. But it fluctuates with the needs of the military. My class only have to serve 3 years active duty because of they were lessening the number of people in the Army at that time. Check out the websites of the universities you are most likely to go to, specifically the Rotc program at those schools, and the websites for the military academies for the requirements and specifics.</p>\n",

When I was in High School I was part of a NJROTC  (Navy Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps) they taught me all about the military branches.  It was nice because you are not only part of the team but also you get to live the life of a cadet. You wear a uniform and get inspected just as if you were reporting for duty. These units also have specialty teams which will allow you to try out different skills and see what you like.  If you know the military is the way you want to go then becoming an officer within the ROTC class will be seamless for you. </p><p><br></p><p>If your school does not have an ROTC unit reach out to your local military recruiters and they can help find you a program to volunteer your time.</p><p><br></p><p>As for college, most fighter pilot programs is through the military branch you enlist in.

      "</p>\n",
      "<p>First, all of the Armed Services (Army, Navy, Air Force &amp; Marines) have opportunities for individuals to join that service as an Officer after obtaining a college degree.  You can obtain your degree and join the service in a few ways: 1. Attend a military academy (e.g., the Naval Academy for a Marine Officer Commission: see <a href=\"http://www.usna.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.usna.edu</a>). The academies are also great places to study engineering. 2. Attend one of many universities to get your degree and attend Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) classes. ROTC can help fund your college and you have wide latitude in selecting your major (Check out the Navy ROTC website at <a href=\"http://www.nrotc.navy.mil\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.nrotc.navy.mil</a>). 3. Attend college on your own and then join the service of your choice, either through Officer Candidate School if you want to be an officer (probably more suitable for aviation or engineering service) or through enlisting in the Marines. </p>\n",
      "<p>Second, you should decide if you want to study aeronautical engineering and/or be a practicing engineer. You didn't indicate if you want to fly or not and that might also influence your choice - each service's website can tell you more about the requirements for becoming a pilot. Typically the actual engineering done for military aircraft is done by civilians, though military test pilots in all services work to evaluate the flight performance of these aircraft. The bulk of the practicing engineers in the uniformed military are civil engineers (eg, the Army Corps of Engineers). </p>\n",
      "<p>Finally, you should decide if the career you pursue in the military is the one you want to pursue for your life, or if you are willing to hold another position while in the Marines and pursue applied engineering later.  If that is the case, my recommendation is to obtain the best engineering degree you can and select a military job that will challenge you and reward you. Military service will provide you with tremendous leadership opportunities and opportunities to pursue advanced education as well.</p>\n",

      " <p>My best advice would be to visit a recruiter for whatever military branch you decide to enter. The recruiter can let you know what jobs are currently available for the branch of service that you are considering. Most any job that you see in the civilian world, can be performed in the military. Everything from being a police officer, computer technician, scientist, doctor, nurse, civil engineer, or even special forces troop. If you want to work 20 years in the military for a retirement, I suggest enlisting, or commissioning into an active duty role with the military. This is full time service that will give you all of the military benefits that you deserve, afterwards, you can always fall back to a part time role with the reserves or national guard if you decide full time service is not for you. If you first enlist in the guard or reserves and want to go full time at a later date, it is so much harder, if not impossible to do. In that case the best you can hope for is a dual status military technician role which will place you on the federal civil service payroll which has a different payscale and benefits than going active duty, you'd then also be required to attend monthy drill and annual training with your guard or reserve unit in a military status. In essence, you wear two hats, during the week you are considered a federal civilian even though you are required to wear your uniform to work, then once per month, you would have to show up on the weekend to the same job but get paid according to your military rank. I know, its confusing. Here is a link to a site that I think is very helpful in explaining how to go full time with the reserves / guard if you decide not to go active duty from the start: http://www.wantscheck.com/GuardReserve/GuardReserveHiring/tabid/74/Default.aspx</p>\n",

The military can absolutely be a great option either as a career or for a means to a way, the way being finance for college or a bit of independence/mature building to ready you for college.  Conversely, college can certainly lead to a career, a career in the military as an officer once you obtain your degree is one career you could consider.   That is to say, you can use military service as a way to gain maturity and finances towards college attendance if those are things you could use.  If you want to be an officer in the military, you could use college to get you to that goal.

      " <p>Andre S. , the military is one option in paying for college.  Joining the military just for paying college would probably lead to some disappointment.  If you enlist in the military or attend as an ROTC Cadet, you will be obligated to remain the military for a number of years, sort of paying back the military for assisting with paying for your college education.  If you look at the military as a means to supplement your college education AND provide you with meaningful work experience, then this would be the route to take.  When you enter the military you will be provided other experiences that many college students do not experience as well as many civilians.  Talk to your family, friends, family members who have served in the military.  I have served 27 years in the Army Reserves and currently still serving.  Serving in the military has its risk of possible deployment to defend the Constitution, take a look at the issues in North Korea, Middle East, Europe.  It is a sacrifice, but the rewards are high of serving and having the military assist you in obtaining your goal to graduate.  The positive is that you will learn a possible skill(s) in the military that would be transferable to the civilian sector.  For example, if you are interested in Cyber, the military trains you for this, the civilian sector is hiring cyber specialists.  There are other military specialties that do that same.  in the end, for my 27+ years of serving, I will be receiving a retirement from the military, my daughters will have some of their college education paid for as well.

You could also inquire about attending the military academies (West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and the Coast Guard Academy). Fantastic education and graduates enter the military as officers upon graduation. I am a West Point graduate and was a pilot in the U.S. Air Force.

      " <p>Hi, Deshawn,</p><p><br></p><p>I am a former Army Infantry Officer and  agree with a lot of the points made in your previous answers. I strongly echo the sentiment that it is very unrealistic to expect not to deploy, regardless of what branch you join. Honestly, if you don't want to deploy, I'd recommend choosing a different path than the military. Whether you are in the Army, Air Force, or Navy, deployments are at the core of what you do. If you aren't prepared to go overseas then I don't think the military is the right place for you. There are plenty of places to get experience in the two areas you mentioned and, if you want to serve, you might want to investigate the Coast Guard. I linked their careers page below.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope this helps - good luck in whatever path you ultimately choose to pursue.

      " Remember, joining the military is not for everybody. Only 29% of all Americans are qualified to join the military. (http://time.com/2938158/youth-fail-to-qualify-military-service/) If you are doing it for the college money, you are doing it for the wrong reason. If you can join the military, it will be a change to your way of life. You will be taken away from your home and stripped of what you know. You will be given tools to be successful and learn to put others before your own. Here is an idea, if you want to go to college and serve the military, join the Reserves. You will gain valuable skills, stay in or around your current location, and they will help pay for college.  FYI- Joining the military is not like the movies. Movies are made to sell tickets. The military is there to save lives and protect our freedoms. \n",

      " <p>The opinions expressed in the comments below are the opinion of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Army or the Department of Defense. </p>\n",
      "<p>This is a challenging but interesting question and it's great that you are considering it at this point in your life.  To be honest, I'm not sure that there is only one career path as the Army is a very large and diverse organization.  There are however a few important decisions that an individual needs to make.</p>\n",
      "<p>First, is the Army (or military) right for me?  To answer this question you should talk with your family and friends and try to find someone in the military to talk to.  The military presents you with many job, educational and travel opportunities but it is demanding work that often requires separation from your family and occasionally dangerous work. You should be sure that you want to serve in the military before joining.</p>\n",
      "<p>Second, what type of work do I want to do (Intelligence Analysis, Mechanic, Infantry, Pilot, etc...)? To help answer this question, there is a great deal of information on Army jobs (called Military Occupation Specialties) on the Army website; there are a variety of message boards accessible on the internet discussing different jobs and their associated training and assignments; and military recruiters can advise individuals on the available jobs and the requirements for each of them. Different jobs may require mechanical orientations or mathematical skills.  High school and your work experience may prepare you for your service.</p>\n",
      "<p>Third, do I want to serve as an enlisted soldier or an officer? Servicemembers of different ranks have different jobs and different responsibilities, with enlisted soldiers generally acquiring more technical skills and officers acquiring more leadership and managerial skils.  If you want to enlist then you need to have at least a high school diploma.  If you desire to serve as an officer you will need to obtain a college degree.  Accordingly, you should spend your time in high school preparing yourself for college and for completion of your pre-commissioning requirements (through Reverve Officers Training Corps or the United States Military Academy at West Point). Both of these options can assist you in paying for college but they require qualification and service in the Army after your college graduation and commissioning.  Again, the Army website is a great resource for learning about the options available to you.  Both ROTC and USMA provide great opportunities to learn about the Army and to develop yourself academically, physically and militarily while in college.  Whether you want to enlist or become an officer, you need to develop your physical fitness, maintain a good work history, and avoid any criminal behavior.</p>\n",
      "<p>Once you have joined the military the key to a successful career is hard work and teamwork.  The jobs are demanding and require you to operate in a fast-paced environment with flexibility and self-motivation. Promotions require successful service in each job and at each level of authority.  Nonetheless, you will not be alone.  In the service you will develop tremendous friendships and accomplish many goals as a unit.  Your leaders, peers and subordinates will all be important parts of your daily life and your career progression.  As you advance in rank you will have additional opportunities to pursue more military and civilian schooling, different jobs, and service in different locations in the U.S. and abroad.  The career path in the Army is no doubt unique- it will require you and your family to make many sacrifices but it also will reward you with self-development, travel and job opportunities, friendships and service.</p>\n",

So I would say go for it and yes you can become a police officer before or after the military. There are college programs that offer the police academy right out the door. So you may want ot find those colleges and become a peace officer or sheriff, or a highway patrolman many areas of law, armed forces too. Always in high demand because of our large population. Good luck with your journey. Get with an Army or armed forces recruiter you may be surprised to find you can choose the mos or job you want after your exam that you take.

      "It appears to me that you are interested in becoming an officer in the U.S. Army.  I retired from the U.S. Army as a Lieutenant Colonel after 30 years of service.   There are at least two ways for you to become an Army officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "After you finish high school,  you should attend a university in the U.S. that has an Army R.O.T.C. (Reserve Officers Training Corps) program.  In this way, you work towards your degree and meeting your Army Officer training simultaneously.  You'll then be commissioned at the same time you receive your Bachelors Degree.  There are ROTC scholarships for which you can apply too.  Start the application process in your (High School) Junior year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another route is to enlist in the U.S. Army and apply for and attend Officer Candidate School (OCS).  The \"catch\" here is you ultimately must have a Bachelors Degree.   I recommend getting your degree first before going the OCS route.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the route you choose, ultimately you will need to be academically strong in the following disciplines:  ENGLISH communication skills; both written and verbal.  MATH - calculus would be very beneficial in your preparation.  Be well-rounded in SCIENCES, especially \"hard sciences\" i.e. physics.  HISTORY is very important too.  Both U.S. History and World History with an emphasis on Military History.    Additionally,  we (U.S. Army) will look at your LEADERSHIP experience while in \"high school\".  For example:  President of the Chess or Robotics club, or Captain of the football or soccer team.   Being a member of a sports team or teams is something else that we look at.  We want you to be a \"TEAM PLAYER\"  and a leader.  Soccer or football or basketball or baseball will rate higher than swimming or track for example.  PHYSICAL FITNESS is vitally important.  You should be \"height / weight proportionate\".   \n",
      "\n",
      "Your background is very important too.   Membership in questionable or subversive or even anti-American organizations will be a \"war-stopper\" for you.  Your application to become an officer will be denied for these activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mean time, research the various \"branches\" within the Army.  for example:  Aviation, Field Artillery, Military Intelligence, Transportation, Cyber, Engineers, Judge Advocate, Infantry, Signal, etc..  Begin to determine what you do not want to do, then narrow it down to what you do want to do.   Math is extremely important in Artillery and Aviation.   Physical fitness as well as being academically \"well rounded\" is important in Infantry and Special Operations.   Language skills are especially important in Special Operations.\n",

      " <p>My personal experience was to attend college first, and then join the military...admittedly, that plan was formed because I attended college with an ROTC scholarship.  But several of my high school and college friends joined the military and I talked with a lot of them during their decision making.  What I found was that attending college first provided more options on how to serve in the military - specifically, whether to serve in the officer ranks or the enlisted ranks.  To be an officer a college degree is required...so if you have that done, you can choose either the officer route or enlisted.  Without the college degree, your only option is to go the enlisted route.  Both are excellent paths to take in the military - my point is that with the college degree, you'll have more options on how you want to serve.</p>\n",
      "<p>Another consideration is to do both at the same time - you can be in college full time and also be in the Reserves (1 weekend a month, 2 weeks a year).  That way, when college is complete you'll not only have the options I referred to but you'll also have real military experience under your belt.  The risk there is that if your Reserve Unit gets called to Active status, you'll need to put your college studies on hold.  But it's definitely something to consider and discuss with someone who is in the process of doing the same - your local Armed Services recruiting office should have contacts you can talk to.

The Air Force Academy is a highly competitive school so not all that apply get in – you can find requirements online. Also, the last I knew the Air force Academy doesn’t charge tuition, the cost is written off as they ask you to the join the Air Force. I would check with the school because how long you have to enlist is based on what your major is and other qualifications that may be needed (example: you will not be able to do a 4 year program and then medical school and only serve 4 years – it will probably be longer). If you go to a regular college and then join you will enlist as an officer anyway. I think any type of schooling along with enlistment is admirable. I wish you all the best! #airforcebiased</p>\n",

      " <p>Firefighting is certainly a tough career to get into, because the availability is limited. Police work on the other hand is something that is generally more available to get into. As a 4 year Navy veteran, I definitely think that going into the military will help your chances of becoming a police officer. It doesn't necessarily mean you're a \"shoe-in\" for the job, but the military experience and training will certainly help guide you in the right direction if you're interested in law enforcement. If you're really interested in being a firefighter, you should try to go into the Navy as a Damage Controlman. They are essentially the Navy's firefighters and emergency response onboard our navy vessels. Their training is top notch, as it should be, because if your ship is on fire out to sea, there is nowhere to escape to. You either put out the fire or lose the ship. If you're going to go in the military, go Navy or Air Force. Trust me. Army and Marines is rewarding as well, don't get me wrong, but you don't need to see a combat zone in order to gain the necessary experience. As far as law enforcement related jobs are concerned, go into the Air Force for Security Forces or the Navy as a Master-at-Arms. Those military rates will lead you in the right direction for what you're looking for. Hope that helps! Best of luck to you!</p>\n",

The point of the reserves are that they are trained and signed on in case the government needs the Navy, Army or Marine reservist for national assignments. I know that the guard is being used daily for many things. Sometimes the different areas help in clean up of major weather conditons that have devistated regions, they help with the clean up efforts, the guarding of and so people will not loot. They guard. That is the National Guard. The Navy was recently used for the search of a missing plane. Sometimes they can call up reserves if reserves are needed. That is the point of the reserve. Any job that you go to or career path you take are bound by law to allow you to perform your Naval duties first and formost, because if they did not you would be A.W.O.L. and this is not good. Here is what my daughter did she worked out with the Army recruiter for almost 3 months before she decided this is what she chose to do. She looked at Army, Navy, Marines, the Air Force, and the Guard. She chose Army. She loves the Army. She did her homework like you are. You are checking on what it takes to join. You must pass bootcamp. So if you need to work on eating proper meals and working out before that you go now would be the time to start so you can pass the Physical Test. Then there is a second test for your MOS that would be the job you get to choose to do depending on what you scored on the exam. The Naval recruiter will work with you on this. He or she will give you a list of what jobs you can do as to what you scored on your test. So you want to study that before taking the test. The recruiter will help you do EVERYTHING. that you need to do. The great points here are if you need to learn to drive the Navy will help you get EVERYTHING. If you need housing no worries covered, food covered. This is what is so good about the Armed Forces they do take care of eachother. You are a comard. Your piers are comrards. I think this is a great career choice. Just for General Purpose. My uncle is a retired Military Coast Guard Captain he was in the Coast Guard for 40 plus years. He has a good pension now, very stable life substantial income, he and his wife live nicely. He teaches safty classes now. He has been known to make 10000 dollars a day doing this or navigating ships. So you may want to look at the Coast Guard too. They also have sign on bonus for college, I say have fun with it and go for it . You can do it attitude. Be confident in your decisons. YOU do have what it takes to be in the Armed Forces. Good luck.</p>\n",

If you go enlisted, you would not get paid as well as if you went as an officer. However, if you go as an officer, there was less of a guarantee of what career field you would go into.

      " <p>Hi. I joined the Army after I attended college and received a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice.  Commissioned officers enter the Military with a four year degree or receive officer training after joining and complete a tour. You can prepare yourself by taking Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) while in high school or a university. You can also attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) after graduating from college or become commissioned by earning a professional degree. If you decide to earn a degree, think about what you would like to do while in the military.  The experience in the military was very rewarding. I wish you well and much success in your future. </p>\n",

      " <p>Hi,\n",
      "Josh and Matt make valid points about the military being a large commitment. I'm not sure about military having \"more\" success at being hired with the legacy carriers (Southwest, United, American, Delta, Alaska). The current stats at Delta, where I fly, are about 50/50 hiring military vs non-military for new hires in the last 3 years. Both paths bring different, but respected, perspectives and experience. For the record, I'm a military pilot (12 years active duty, the last 4 years in the Air National Guard). Another option you may want to consider is a \"blend\" of military and civilian. And that is to be hired by the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserves. If you fly for the ANG/AFR, you will have the same 10 year commitment, however you will only be \"full time\" military for the first 2-3 years to get through training and get seasoned. After that, you can serve as a traditional guardsman/reservist, which means part-time. Part-time ends up being about 5-10 days a month. The airlines must let you take military leave to serve those days. We have several folks in my unit who are traditional guardsmen, and fly for the regionals. When they get enough hours they'll apply for the major airlines with both military and civilian experience. In the interest of full disclosure, a part-time guardsman/reservist will have periods where they will have to serve overseas and/or be on orders \"full time\", but generally those full-time periods are short...60-90 days maybe about once a year, and in some units once every couple years. Plus, you will get education benefits with the Post 9-11 GI Bill. </p>\n",
      "<p>You do need to have a college degree to apply to be a pilot in the ANG/AFR--it is a commissioned officer position. If you have financial challenges with getting to college first, you can also enlist in the ANG/AFR which will provide you a part-time job in college, as well as provide financial assistance for college. If you don't mind being on Active Duty for 10 years, you can also apply for an ROTC scholarship which will pay for a good 80-90% of your college (stick with Air Force or Navy if flying is your ultimate goal) or apply for the US Air Force Academy or Naval Academy. The academies are very competitive...ROTC scholarships are competitive but less so...and you can choose where you go to school (as long as that school has an ROTC unit). </p>\n",
      "<p>These days, I think either way you choose, if you have the flight experience, team-oriented personality, and are willing to do what you need to do to meet your goals, you can get hired going either the military or civilian route.  </p>\n",

      "<p>There are several ways to join the Armed Forces as officers . To broadly classify, you can either join after finishing your class 12 or after graduation. And also you can join either as a Permanent Commission Officer or a Short Service Commission Officer.</p>\n",
      "<p>Entries after Class 12th</p>\n",
      "<p>All entries after class 12 are compulsorily PERMANENT COMMISSION. As a Permanent Commission Officer you will be required to serve for a minimum period of 20 years from the date of commission. Though you may leave before 20 years also but you will not be eligible for life long pension and other ex-service men facilities which will be applicable if you retire after 20 years.</p>\n",
      "<p>National Defence Academy</p>\n",
      "<p>The National Defence Academy is situated in Khadakwasala, Pune. NDA produces the finest fighters of the Armed Forces in our country. The cream of the Armed Forces are produced from NDA. Most cadets from Army join Artillery or Infantry. All cadets from Air Force become pilots. All the Naval Cadets join the Executive Branch. The NDA offers BSc courses which are 3 years long.</p>\n",
      "<p>The candidates who have completed the 12th Std examinations are eligible to join the NDA. NDA trains cadets to become future officers for the three services. NDA being a Tri Services Institute, Army, Navy and Air Force cadets get training under a single roof. The bonding formed between the cadets will help them function efficiently when they become senior officers in their respective service during war and peace.</p>\n",
      "<p>Basic training is imparted in an Army fashion. All the Cadets wear Army uniforms. NDA offers B.Sc. In PCM, IT/CS and few seats in B.A for Army cadets (only). The NDA has an excellent infrastructure. All costs are borne by the government including the tuition fees and hostel fees during the course of training. Even the to and fro journey performed during semester holidays are free of cost.</p>\n",
      "<p>The cadets on graduating will go to their respective service for further 1 year training before getting commissioned. The Army cadets will go to Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehradun. The Airforce cadets will go to Airforce Academy Dindugal, Hyderabad. And all the Naval Cadets will go to the First Training squadron for Sea Training followed by midshipmen time onboard fleet ships (procedure likely to be revised for Navy). At the end of this one year (four years from joining Academy) all trainees will be Commissioned as Officers.</p>\n",
      "<p>In order to join the NDA, a student has to clear the UPSC exam and SSB interview. There are two batches every year. One starting in Jan and the other in Jul.</p>\n",
      "<p>The UPSC exam consists of a 900 marks exam in 2 different papers. 300 marks for Maths and 600 for Physics, Chemistry, English, History, Geography, G.K, IQ etc. You will have to select your service Army, Navy or Airforce while filling up your UPSC form.</p>\n",
      "<p>Once a service has been selected it can not be changed. There will be 4 options. Army, Navy, Air Force and Naval Academy. If you get selected then the Army, Navy and Air Force cadets will go to NDA for Training whereas Naval Academy cadets will go to Naval Academy, Ezhimala in Kerala for training. Navy being a technically more advanced service has the requirement to train its officers in a B.Tech degree.</p>\n",
      "<p>Since NDA functions for 3 year courses only and introducing B.Tech is not feasible for one service, the navy has commenced training its cadets parallely in B.Tech stream in Naval Academy from 2010. However, inorder to maintain the tri services spirit of NDA the naval cadets of Navy in NDA continue to get trained in the traditional way. The date of commission and seniority of Officers from Naval Academy and NDA remains the same. There is no question of who has more advantage in service, since their date of commission remains the same and job profile will also be the same. Just that you will be a B.Tech if you are from Naval Academy or you will be a B.Sc. If you are from NDA.</p>\n",
      "<p>Naval Academy</p>\n",
      "<p>The Naval Academy is similar to the National Defence Academy in all aspects except that it offers 4 years B.Tech course instead of a 3 years BSc course. Naval Academy is situated in Ezhimala, Kerala. The Academy en-composes a very vast campus with 3 different beaches, islands, rivers inside the Academy. The state of the art infrastructure, indoor swimming pools, computer aided training, excellent sports facilities etc make it the most modern and futuristic Defence Academy amongst all the other defence training academies in India.</p>\n",

The Army and Navy carries out this entry. The Army cadets on joining the College of Military Engineering – Kirkee, Pune and Naval Cadets on joining Naval Academy -Ezhimala, Kerala undergo 4 years B.Tech courses. There are various branches available like mechanical, electronics and communication engineering etc. The cadets on completion of four years training get commissioned as Officers. The training facilities, way of functioning, rules and regulations etc are all the same as that of NDA.</p>\n",

      "<p>The 10+2 Tech cadets get trained in Naval Academy. Though their entry is different from NDA (Naval Academy Cadets), they get trained together. They are integrated with the Naval Academy Cadets. The cadets on completion of 4 years of training will be commissioned as technical officers.

      " <p>Hi Galicia!</p><p><br></p><p>Do you have to go to the military to become a detective?  No.</p><p><br></p><p>When you go into the military you're subjected to testing (ASVAB - Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery) to determine the best career fit (MOS - military occupational specialty).  This can range from custodian to engineer, infantry to intelligence, etc...  You could be manning the 50 caliber machine gun atop a Humvee in the infantry, or  developing relationships in foreign countries as a psychological operations soldier.  Getting the mos of your choosing is not guaranteed as you have to (1) qualify for the position, and (2) positions must be available.  </p><p><br></p><p>With that said, going into the military is very helpful if you're pursuing a career in law enforcement.  Many law enforcement agencies give preference to military veterans as they've already been subjected to rigorous training and discipline - Massachusetts State Police used to give veterans a 10 point preference on the state police civil servant exam (a non-military individual could score a 97 out of a 100, but the military veteran who scored an 88 will have their score increased to 98 and will be considered first).  I always suggest people to consider a career with the Armed Services if you're not really sure where you want to go in life as the military has so much to offer - like retiring with full pension after 20 years of service!  </p><p><br></p><p>You have a general idea of what you'd like to do with your future.  I would encourage you to expand that idea a bit further - do you want to work as a detective in a local police department, work as an investigator for a federal agency such as the FBI/US Marshals/Border Patrol/etc?  What about an investigator for the fire department, or with the EPA, state police, or even private investigation?  What would you like to investigate - general crimes (burglaries/thefts), drug trafficking, homicides, sex offenses?  There's also cyber/fraud/background investigators, and many more.  The NFL employs investigators to look into the backgrounds of potential up and coming college players.</p><p><br></p><p>I had a college professor who told everyone on the first day of orientation that if you're interested in working as a police officer, including local detectives, to drop out of college (yup, he said to drop out) and apply for a job as a police officer.  He explained this stating how you will advance quicker through the ranks if you start early.  He then went on to discuss how a college degree will help (even more so if combined with military experience) if you're interested in working at a state or federal level.  </p><p><br></p><p>So think about what you'd like to do, google the position requirements, and those requirements will help provide guidance in terms of what steps you should take to eventually land that position!  If you think of a position of interest but are still uncertain about what steps to take - either write back or submit another question such as \"how do I get a job as a (job title).\"  Good luck!!!</p>\n",

    "This system is performing well on careers for which a lot of data is available. Examples include the computer science, military and data science questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For questions about firefighting, psychology and plumbing the number of final recommendations is low. The models are also generating a higher ratio of false positives. There are professionals in the dataset that are qualified to answer these questions and the system is detecting them. But, the final filter is rejecting these professionals because they are not active. Therefore, I believe that the problem is not with this recommendation system. There's just not enough data representing these careers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, this highlights a weakness of this recommender system: For certain questions, especially those where a career has a low representation in the data, model 4 has a tendency to generate many false positives. To see a demonstration of this try entering index 2018 (question id:  b53c5e9b7436453fa13a416a23b512cc). This is a question about becoming a Politician. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Is this a good recommender system?**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these tests my preliminary conclusion is that this recommender system works. However, one should be careful about drawing conclusions after only a quick test like this. This system needs to be field tested. Only then will we know how robust it really is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now just a few thoughts on setting thresholds...**\n",
    "\n",
    "I've tried to reduce the number of irrelevant recommendations (i.e. bad match between question and professional) by setting model 3 and model 4 thresholds to be quite high. Reducing the number of false positives is important to inspire confidence in this system and reduce the amount of irrelevant questions sent to professionals. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider the question: \n",
    "\"I want to become an army officer. What can I do to become an army officer?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "At the current threshold of 0.94 Model 4 is generating 0 recommendations. However, if this threshold were lowered to 0.85 Model 4 would generate 305 recommendations. This would cause an increase in the number of false positives. In addition to recommending more professionals with a military background, Model 4 would also recommend police officers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, if the threshold was set at 0.85 then model 4 would generate 38,220 recommendations when given the very general question: \"What are the best ways to maintain a work and school balance?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "38,220 (contains duplicates) is a lot of professionals and one might guess that many false positives would be generated... but think again - would you or I consider such a question irrelevant?\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, when choosing these thresholds it's important to consider **business priorities**. One of CareerVillage's priorities is 'No question left behind' meaning that no question should be left unanswered. In this case an executive decision could be made to use lower thresholds. The benefit would be that there would be a higher possibility that a question would get an answer because the system would output a longer list of recommended professionals. The risk is that the number of irrelevant questions sent to professionals will increase. One way to manage this risk would be to warn professionals ahead of time that a new system is being tested and request their patience (and possibly their feedback) as the system is being tuned. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another point to consider is that these thresholds are dictated by the amount and quality of the data. As the amount of data increases, these thresholds could be adjusted. This system is not static. Its ongoing performance will need to be monitored. With time it could get better as data quantity increases or it could get worse if the data becomes polluted, with spam for example.\n"

    "I suggest starting by looking at the filter. Are the conditions too strict? Are there better conditions that can be added?<br>\n",

    "**What steps can be taken to address the cold start problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you've just signed up as a shopper on Amazon. The site won't know the most relevant products to recommend to you because you've never bought anything i.e. you don't have a shopping history. This is called the cold start problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here the new professionals are the \"shoppers\" and the \"products\" are the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this recommender system Model 1 gives every professional a chance to be paired with a question. It relies on tags and professional profiles. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Reminder: A Professional's profile includes a professional's industry and title.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, one way of tackling the cold start problem is to encourage new professionals to complete their tag and profile information. There are many professionals whose info is incomplete or sparse. New professionals will have a better chance of being matched if they provide complete and detailed information about themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of addressing the cold start problem is to simply do nothing. Professionals are currently able to scroll the forums to find questions to answer. With time cold start issues will resolve themselves as these professionals find and answer questions. Once they answer a question Model 2, 3 or 4 will automatically match them to more questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fairness**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the requirements for fairness is a diverse dataset. This isn't always easy to create for many reasons, one being that the perspective of those creating it may be limited. Let me explain using a professions vs trades example. (Please note that the term bias here means one-sidedness. Not bias in the sense of bias/variance.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Society tends to esteem professions above trades. Those of us who've reaped the social and financial rewards of a university education would naturally want to encourage all children to follow this path. But not all children want to be doctors. Many can find secure, fullfilling and often lucrative careers as plumbers and electricians. Not everyone knows that such opportunities exist outside the university system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If CareerVillage's marketing team were to target a predominantly white-collar demographic when trying to attract new professionals - then the number of university educated professionals in the dataset will be higher, and growing faster, than the number of tradesmen or tradeswomen. This will lead to a data bias in favour of professions. Any alogorithms constructed using this data will reflect this bias. The consequence - students who submit questions about learning a trade won't get answers. This would be an \"exculsionary user experience\", also known as discrimination. All because the data is not diverse.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why? CareerVillage meets a very real need. It's certain to become popular with more students and professionals, in more countries. Unfortunately this increase in popularity will attract both the good and the bad - human and bot. It's important to build a stoplist into the recommender system that will exclude certain professionals from the final output when that person is promoting an agenda that's contrary to the CareerVillage value system.\n",

    "**Train a Neural Network to automatically rate the quality of answers**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The CareerVillage vision is to give students answers that are tailored, reliable, encouraging and inspirational. There are many answers in the dataset that meet these requirements. Unfortunately, there are also answers that don't. Being able to automatically rate the quality of answers may help improve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "How might this be done?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main pre-requisite is a labeled dataset. Once this is in place one could train a deep neural network to read each answer and then rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 according to the CareerVillage [Pro Tips](https://medium.com/@careervillage/introducing-protips-2d4ad51c445a) guidelines. This neural network could have one of several architectures - DNN, CNN, RNN or even BERT, which is a state of the art pre-trained network created by Google. \n",
